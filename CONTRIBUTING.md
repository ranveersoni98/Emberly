## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome many types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Help us squash bugs and improve stability
- **Features** - Implement new functionality (please discuss first)
- **Documentation** - Improve docs, fix typos, add examples
- **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage
- **Performance** - Optimize code and improve efficiency
- **Accessibility** - Make Emberly more accessible to everyone
- **Translations** - Help translate the interface (coming soon)

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Someone may already be working on it
2. **Open a discussion** - For large features, discuss your approach first
3. **Create an issue** - For bugs or smaller features, create an issue to track work

### Finding Issues to Work On

Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Great for newcomers
- `help wanted` - We'd love community help
- `bug` - Something isn't working correctly
- `enhancement` - New feature or improvement

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or fixes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the linter
bun lint

# Run type checking
bun typecheck

# Build the project
bun run build
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow our [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines):

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user profile avatar upload"
```

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- A clear title describing the change
- A description of what changed and why
- Reference to any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Screenshots for UI changes

### 6. Code Review

- Address reviewer feedback promptly
- Keep discussions constructive and respectful
- Make requested changes in new commits (we'll squash on merge)

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode (`strict: true`)
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use interfaces for object shapes

```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface UserProfile {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}

// ❌ Avoid
const user: any = { ... }
```

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer server components when possible
- Use `'use client'` directive only when necessary
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the existing design system (shadcn/ui)
- Maintain responsive design (mobile-first)
- Support dark mode

### File Organization

```
app/                    # Next.js App Router pages
packages/
  ├── components/       # React components
  ├── lib/              # Utility functions and libraries
  ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
  └── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
prisma/                 # Database schema and migrations
public/                 # Static assets
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: kebab-case (`user-profile.tsx`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (`UserProfile`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (`getUserProfile`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (`UserProfile`)

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) enforced by commitlint.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
