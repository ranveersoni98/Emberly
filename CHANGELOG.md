# Changelog (updated)

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on "Keep a Changelog" and follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Brand Icon System (`skill-icons.tsx`)** — New shared utility in `packages/components/profile/` mapping 100+ skill name patterns to brand icons.
  - Uses **react-icons/si** (Simple Icons SVG) for modern tech: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GraphQL, Tailwind CSS, Svelte, Angular, Kotlin, Flutter, Rust, Go, and more.
  - Uses **devicons CSS font** for supplemental coverage: Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Java, Swift, Dart, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, GitHub, Firebase, AWS, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, jQuery, npm, Laravel, Django, Meteor, Heroku, Jenkins, Travis CI, and more.
  - `getSkillIcon(name)` returns a type-discriminated `si` | `di` entry; `SkillIcon` component renders SVG or devicons glyph with correct brand color.
  - Consumed by both `public-profile.tsx` and `nexium-dashboard.tsx`.
- **Skill Level Bar** — New `SkillLevelBar` component replacing verbose badge text with 4 colored dots (blue/green/orange/purple by level). Used in public profile Talent tab and Nexium dashboard Skills panel.
- **Skills Category Grouping** — Skills are now grouped by category with a subtle category header in both the public profile and Nexium dashboard panels.
- **Signal Type Icon Chips** — Each signal type renders a colored icon chip for quick visual identification. GitHub repo signals use the `SiGithub` brand icon. All signal cards redesigned with bolder title, small uppercase type label, and cleaner layout.
- **Per-Tier Contributor & Booster Badges** — Perk role badges completely redesigned with custom gradient pill styling per tier.
  - **Contributor:** Bronze (amber), Silver (slate/zinc), Gold (yellow), Platinum (cyan/teal), Diamond (sky→violet gradient).
  - **Booster:** Bronze (amber), Silver (slate/zinc), Gold (yellow), Platinum (fuchsia), Diamond (purple→pink gradient).
  - Each badge includes a tier icon and a gradient border, replacing the generic flat `<Badge>` component.
- **Discord Social Link Icon** — Profile Discord social link now renders the `SiDiscord` brand icon (`#5865F2`) instead of the generic `MessageCircle` lucide icon.
- **Admin User Verify** — New admin action to manually verify a user's account.
  - `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/verify` — sets `isVerified: true` (or toggles it) on the target user.
  - `isVerified` and `storageQuotaMB` fields added to `USER_ADMIN_SELECT`; active subscription with product details also included.
  - Verify button in the admin user list shows `BadgeCheck` icon; verified users display a blue checkmark next to their name.
- **Admin User List — Plan & Storage columns** — Each user row now shows:
  - A plan badge (with `Zap` icon and plan name, or "Free" fallback).
  - A storage usage bar with color thresholds (orange at 75%, red at 90%).
- **Subscription Sync Endpoint** — New `POST /api/payments/sync-subscription` re-syncs the authenticated user's active Stripe subscriptions into the database. Useful when the original checkout webhook was missed or not yet configured.
- **Storage Quota Auto-Healing** — `getPlanLimits()` now automatically attempts a one-time Stripe sync when no active subscription is found in the database. A per-user 5-minute TTL cache prevents excessive Stripe calls.
- **Analytics Plan & Usage Card** — `AnalyticsOverview` now includes a Plan & Usage section showing:
  - Current plan name and badge.
  - Storage progress bar with used/total and percentage.
  - Upload size cap and custom domain limit (from plan).
  - `GET /api/analytics/overview` now returns `quotaInfo` and `planInfo` fields.
- **Billing History — Payment Methods & Subscriptions** — The billing settings tab now shows:
  - All saved payment methods (card brand, last 4 digits, expiry, default indicator).
  - All Stripe subscriptions with status badges (Active/Trial/Past Due/Cancelled), renewal date, billing interval, and amount.
  - Fetches all payment method types via `stripe.customers.listPaymentMethods` (captures Link-attached cards that `type:'card'` misses).

### Changed
- **Public Profile Redesign** — `public-profile.tsx` fully rewritten with a tabbed layout (Overview, Files, URLs, Contributions, Talent). Contributions tab lazy-loads on first click.
- **Contributions API Performance** — `GET /api/users/[id]/contributions` parallelized with `Promise.allSettled` — all repo and commit detail fetches now run concurrently, eliminating sequential O(repos × commits) round-trips.
- **Analytics Gating** — `GET /api/analytics/overview` now enforces plan-based gating on `topFiles` and `topUrls` fields (returns empty arrays for free tier) instead of unconditionally sending them.
- **Domain Slot Counting** — `getPurchasedDomainSlots()` now counts yearly subscription domain slots alongside legacy one-off purchases using a parallel `Promise.all` query.
- **`package.json` Cleanup** — Removed `bun` as a runtime dependency; added `react-icons` and `devicons` as explicit dependencies; `tsx` added for script execution.

### Fixed
- **`/u/[shortCode]` Username Lookup** — Short URL redirect now correctly resolves by username/vanity ID instead of raw user ID.
- **Proxy Custom Domain Root Rewrite** — Fixed incorrect rewrite target when a visitor hits `/` on a verified custom domain.
- **Private Profile Handling** — Profile page now correctly shows a private state instead of partially rendering when `profileVisibility` is private.
- **Duplicate Declaration Crash** — Removed stale duplicate code block appended after `public-profile.tsx` rewrite that caused five symbols to be declared twice.
- **Analytics `formatBytes` Unit Bug** — `AnalyticsOverview` was treating MB values as raw bytes; now correctly multiplies by 1 024² before formatting.
- **Stripe Credit Balance Sign** — Billing history was displaying Stripe's negative customer balance (credit) as a negative number; now correctly inverted to show credit as a positive `stripeBalance`.

  - Detects horizontal overflow via `ResizeObserver` + scroll events.
  - Shows left/right fade gradient overlays + `ChevronLeft`/`ChevronRight` icons when content is scrollable in that direction.

### Changed
- **v2 Glass Design System Normalization** - Comprehensive site-wide audit and standardization of all card, surface, and container components.
  - `bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-lg border-border/50 shadow-sm` established as the single canonical surface standard.
  - `Card` component updated from `bg-card/80` to `bg-background/80` to match glass system opacity.
  - 30+ components migrated: file cards, shared file cards, file grid (search, filters, pagination, skeleton), URL list tables, URL form, verification codes panel, analytics overview, blog TOC, upload form, OCR dialog, appearance panel, referrals, and more.
  - `glass-subtle` class redefined from lighter `bg-muted/50` baseline to `bg-background/80 backdrop-blur-md` to match dark glass standard.
  - All remaining `bg-muted/30`, `bg-background/30`, `bg-background/50` surface patterns normalized to `bg-background/80`.
  - Hardcoded `dark:` overrides (e.g. `dark:bg-muted/20`, `dark:bg-black/5`) removed from dashboard components — theme-aware tokens handle both modes.
  - `border-white/[0.0x]` → `border-border/X` and `bg-white/[0.0x]` → `bg-muted/X` replacements throughout.
  - Profile settings sidebar, admin settings sidebar, and all section panels brought to v2 dark glass standard.

### Fixed
- **Broken Nexium Import Paths** - Corrected 24 API routes and lib files importing from non-existent `discovery` module paths post-rebrand.
  - `@/packages/lib/discovery` → `@/packages/lib/nexium` in 13 `app/api/discovery/**` route files.
  - `@/packages/types/dto/discovery` → `@/packages/types/dto/nexium` in 11 `app/api/discovery/**` route files.
  - Root cause: automated rebrand pass renamed source directories but also incorrectly rewrote internal import paths.
- **Build Errors — Duplicate Variable Declarations** - Fixed 8 duplicate `const user` and 1 duplicate `const response` blocking production build.
  - `profile/avatar`, `profile/bash`, `profile/flameshot`, `profile/sharex`, `profile/spectacle`: `requireAuth` returns `{ user }` then same block re-declared `const user` from a Prisma query — renamed DB result to `dbUser` and updated all field accesses.
  - `analytics/summary` and `analytics/export`: same `user` duplication pattern; `analytics/summary` also had duplicate `const response` — renamed result object to `result` throughout.
- **Build Error — Missing Module** - Fixed `contact/route.ts` importing from non-existent `@/packages/lib/notifications`.
  - Corrected to `@/packages/lib/events/utils/discord-webhook` which is the actual `notifyDiscord` export location.

  - Recovery codes now display in a Dialog modal instead of inline expansion for better focus and security.
  - Modal features scrollable code list with `max-h-[50vh]` preventing viewport overflow on long lists.
  - Statistics grid improved with responsive layout: 2 columns on mobile, 4 columns on desktop (`grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4`).
  - Text sizes scale appropriately: `text-xs sm:text-sm` for labels, `text-xl sm:text-2xl` for stats.
  - Action buttons (View Codes, Regenerate Codes) stack vertically on mobile with full width.
  - Modal action buttons (Download as File, Copy All Codes) use default size instead of small for better tap targets.
  - Code display cards feature `break-all` on code text to handle long strings gracefully.
  - Warning banners and important notices use responsive text sizing for readability.
- **GitHub Contributions API Optimization** - Improved reliability and performance of contribution statistics.
  - Reduced commits fetched per repository from 10 to 5 to avoid GitHub API rate limiting.
  - Added individual try-catch blocks around commit detail fetches to prevent single failures from breaking entire stats.
  - Improved error handling with specific error logging per commit and repository.
  - Stats calculation (additions, deletions, files changed) now properly accumulates even with partial failures.
- **Press Pages Theme Compatibility** - Fixed hardcoded colors to respect active theme.
  - Press page hero section now uses theme variables (`text-foreground`, `text-primary`) instead of hardcoded colors.
  - Media kit color palette dynamically pulls from CSS variables to display actual theme colors.
  - Color swatches show live theme values with proper hex code extraction from computed styles.

### Fixed
- **Rich Embeds Metadata System** - Fixed inconsistent behavior where `enableRichEmbeds` setting was not respected for all file types.
  - **Images now respect `enableRichEmbeds=false`**: Previously images always showed preview regardless of setting; now returns minimal metadata with no image preview.
  - **Videos now respect `enableRichEmbeds=false`**: Previously videos still generated video metadata; now returns minimal metadata with no media.
  - **Middleware now checks user settings**: Updated `bot-handler.ts` to query user's `enableRichEmbeds` setting from database before redirecting bot requests.
  - **No embed metadata when disabled**: When rich embeds are disabled, `buildMinimalMetadata()` returns pure metadata with NO `openGraph` or `twitter` card data, ensuring Discord/Twitter show plain links without any embed cards.
  - **Videos work properly when enabled**: When `enableRichEmbeds=true`, videos use raw URL directly so Discord/Twitter can extract their own thumbnail and play the video inline.
  - Bot request handling: For non-video files with rich embeds disabled, middleware redirects to `/raw` so bots get the file directly; for videos, redirects to `/raw` only when embeds disabled.
  - Root cause: Middleware was unconditionally redirecting image bot requests to `/raw` before metadata evaluation, and metadata builders were still generating embed tags even when disabled.
- **Authentication System Domain Configuration** - Resolved production OAuth redirects incorrectly using `https://localhost:3000`.
  - Fixed all OAuth callback routes (GitHub and Discord) to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable.
  - Updated proxy middleware redirects (alpha migration, email verification, password breach, login, admin authorization) to respect configured base URL.
  - Fixed auth library email notification URLs (new login alerts) to use correct production domain.
  - Replaced 18 instances of `new URL('/path', request.url)` pattern which preserved incoming request's protocol/host.
  - All auth redirects now use: `const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || 'https://embrly.ca'`.
  - Ensures OAuth success/error redirects, middleware security checks, and email links all use correct production domain.
  - Root cause: Using `request.url` as base URL caused redirects to inherit the request's domain, including localhost in development.
- **Static Asset Loading Issues** - Resolved CSS and JavaScript not loading for some users.
  - Updated middleware matcher to explicitly exclude all static asset types from authentication checks.
  - Added exclusions for: CSS files (`.css`), JavaScript (`.js`), font files (`.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`, `.otf`).
  - Included `_next/webpack-hmr` exclusion for hot module replacement during development.
  - Prevents middleware from intercepting and potentially blocking critical static resources.
  - Root cause: Middleware regex was not comprehensive enough, causing some users to experience missing styles.
- **Theme Effects Hydration Mismatch** - Fixed React hydration errors caused by browser extensions injecting elements.
  - Created `ThemeEffectsContainer` client component that renders nothing on server and only creates the container div after hydration.
  - Replaced static `<div id="theme-effects-root">` in layout with client-only `<ThemeEffectsContainer />`.
  - Updated `Snowfall` component to track mount state and only render canvas after client hydration.
  - Prevents browser extensions (like Dark Reader) from causing mismatches by injecting elements into server-rendered divs.
  - Root cause: Server rendered empty div, but browser extensions injected `<link>` or `<style>` elements before React hydrated.
- **Root Layout Theme Configuration** - Fixed `InvalidCharacterError` when theme config object was passed to HTML attribute.
  - Added `typeof` guards to ensure only string values are passed to theme-related attributes.
  - Prevents `[object Object]` from being passed when config returns an object instead of a string.
  - Applies to `config.settings.appearance.theme` and `config.settings.appearance.systemThemes` values.

  - Codes stored in database with used/unused tracking and timestamps.
  - Users can regenerate codes anytime to invalidate old ones and create new ones.
  - Recovery codes work as valid 2FA authentication alongside TOTP codes.
  - **Enhanced Recovery Codes UI** - Beautiful glass-morphism design with individual copy buttons, copy-all functionality, and download as text file.
  - **View Codes Anytime** - "View Codes" button allows users to fetch and display all unused recovery codes on demand (not just after generation).
  - Individual code copy buttons with visual feedback (checkmark animation on copy).

  - 2FA enforcement in NextAuth credentials provider: users with `twoFactorEnabled` must enter a valid authenticator code before login succeeds.
  - Added `twoFactorEnabled` and `twoFactorSecret` fields to JWT and session interfaces for persistent 2FA state tracking.
  - Proper error-based 2FA flow: throws `TwoFactorRequired` error when 2FA is enabled but code not provided, forcing frontend to show 2FA form.

  - Removed 150+ lines of unnecessary helper functions (`buildOpenGraphImages`, `buildOpenGraphAudio`, `buildTwitterMetadata`, `buildOtherMetadata`).
  - Removed hardcoded image references in favor of Next.js auto-detection of `opengraph-image.tsx` and `twitter-image.tsx`.
  - Improved URL handling using URL constructor instead of manual string manipulation.
  - `enableRichEmbeds` setting now properly enforced: disables rich metadata for both images and videos, returning minimal metadata instead.
  - Password-protected files now return minimal metadata to prevent embedding sensitive content in social previews.
  - Added strict `fileId` validation requirement for rich metadata generation to ensure thumbnail URLs are available.
- Login form updated to detect 2FA requirement and display `TwoFactorForm` component:
  - Stores pending credentials during 2FA verification flow.
  - Clear error messaging for invalid authenticator codes.
  - "Back to login" button allows users to restart authentication flow.
- Dashboard metadata conflicts resolved:
  - Removed redundant metadata definitions from `dashboard/layout.tsx` and `pricing/layout.tsx`.
  - Each dashboard page now defines its own specific metadata with unique titles and descriptions.
  - Applied `buildPageMetadata()` consistently across all dashboard pages.
- Short URL layout metadata cleaned up:
  - Removed 30+ lines of verbose metadata with explicit null/empty field definitions.
  - Simplified to only include essential `robots: { index: false, follow: false }` to prevent search engine indexing.
- OG/Twitter image generation updated to use actual Emberly logo instead of placeholder.
  - Logo now renders with dynamic colors based on selected theme.
  - Proper two-color flame icon design applied to social media previews.

- README updated to clearly establish this as the Emberly Cloud instance:
  - Added tech stack documentation (Next.js 14, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma, NextAuth.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui).
  - Clarified distinction between this cloud-hosted repository and the upcoming self-hosted open-source distribution.
  - Included cloud-specific features (Stripe billing, Resend email, analytics, 2FA).
  - Added development setup instructions.

### Fixed
- Critical 2FA enforcement vulnerability: users with 2FA enabled were able to bypass authentication without entering an authenticator code.
  - Root cause: NextAuth's `authorize` function was returning user objects on password validation, which NextAuth interprets as successful authentication regardless of 2FA status.
  - Solution: Changed to throw `Error('TwoFactorRequired')` when 2FA is enabled but code is missing, properly failing authentication and forcing 2FA prompt on frontend.
- **Recovery Codes Manager Component Fixes**:
  - Fixed missing icon exports (`download` and `refresh`) in `Icons` component causing "undefined component" runtime errors.
  - Fixed password requirement for recovery code regeneration - now optional for authenticated users since they're already verified.
  - Fixed API response parsing to handle `{ data, success }` wrapper format from `apiResponse()` helper.
  - Fixed `.length` TypeError by properly unwrapping API responses and providing safe fallbacks for `newCodes` array.
- EmberlyIcon component now respects all theme modes including individual hue selections.
  - Updated to use Tailwind `fill-foreground` and `fill-primary` classes instead of inline CSS variables.
  - Icon properly displays with custom theme colors set via the theme customizer.
- Login tracking IP address and device information now properly captured and stored.
  - Updated proxy middleware to extract client IP from multiple header sources with proper fallback handling.
  - Login context (IP, UserAgent, Geo) now passed through to NextAuth callbacks via global context store.
- Metadata loading inconsistencies for Twitter and Open Graph embeds:
  - Simplified fallback chains reduced failure points.
  - Fixed `enableRichEmbeds` being ignored for some file types.
  - Improved validation to prevent undefined/null values in metadata generation.
  - Protected files no longer expose metadata that could reveal sensitive information in social previews.
- Metadata coverage gaps:
  - All public and admin pages now have explicit metadata exports, ensuring consistent SEO and social preview handling.
  - Removed metadata configuration fragmentation across layouts and pages.
- Metadata inheritance override issue: `(main)` layout's `generateMetadata()` was incorrectly overriding child page metadata.
  - Root cause: Next.js layout metadata exports take precedence over child page metadata, causing pages like `/about` to display incorrect metadata.
  - Solution: Removed dynamic `generateMetadata()` from `(main)` layout, allowing each page to properly define its own metadata without interference.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- Dynamic Open Graph and Twitter card images (`opengraph-image.tsx`, `twitter-image.tsx`) using Next.js ImageResponse API with Hawkins Neon theme styling, Emberly branding, and feature pills.
- Current plan banner on pricing page: dedicated `CurrentPlanBanner` component displaying the user's active plan prominently above the plans grid with plan details, feature preview pills, and "Manage Billing" link.
- CORS headers and `OPTIONS`/`HEAD` handlers added to raw file route (`/[userUrlId]/[filename]/raw`) for Discord and Twitter video embed compatibility.
- Video metadata tags: explicit `og:video`, `og:video:secure_url`, `og:video:type`, `og:video:width`, and `og:video:height` meta tags in `buildOtherMetadata` for proper video embeds on social platforms.

### Changed
- Pricing page tabs restyled: `TabsList` and billing cycle toggle now share consistent glass-morphism styling (`bg-muted/50 rounded-xl`) with matching active states (`bg-primary text-primary-foreground`).
- Plans grid refactored: current plan is now separated from the upgrade options grid; remaining plans display under an "Upgrade your plan" section header.
- `PlanSection` component restructured into smaller components (`CurrentPlanBanner`, `PlanCard`) for cleaner code organization.
- Video thumbnail route updated to handle video files by redirecting to a placeholder or generating appropriate thumbnails.
- Bot handler logic clarified for video content type detection and metadata delivery.

### Fixed
- Magic link authentication session loading: fixed `sessionVersion` mismatch where the stale value was used instead of the incremented value from `prisma.user.update()`, causing immediate session invalidation after login.
- Middleware constants: fixed typo in `PUBLIC_PATHS` array that could cause incorrect path matching.
- Pricing tabs `RovingFocusGroupItem` error: restored `TabsList` wrapper around `TabsTrigger` components to satisfy Radix UI's accessibility context requirements.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- Commitlint for enforcing some sort of standard with commit messages.
- Server-side 2FA endpoints: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/profile/2fa` generating TOTP secrets and QR data (uses `otplib` + `qrcode`), plus client-friendly payloads.
- Client 2FA flows: full enable flow (QR + code confirmation) and a new multi-step disable flow (warning → code → password → confirm → disable).
- DB migration: `User` fields `twoFactorEnabled` and `twoFactorSecret` added and migrated locally to persist per-user 2FA state.
- Appearance and theming: per-user `theme` persisted via `PUT /api/profile`, `ThemeInitializer` ensures `data-theme` on `<html>` pre-hydration for consistent previews and Snowfall activation.
- Snowfall: site-wide falling-snow visual component added and wired to theme detection so it activates for Christmas/Holly themes.
- Docs now render through `MarkdownRenderer` (Getting Started, API, Custom Domains, User Guide, ShareX, Flameshot) for consistent anchors, code fence styling, and link handling across docs/blog.
- Dashboard file grid UX: filters wrap and size correctly on mobile (full-width stack, tighter gaps), and the desktop search now starts collapsed and toggles open/closed via a search button for better readability.
- Transactional email system wired for outbound product comms and notifications (Resend-backed) with templated delivery.
- Database-backed documentation: new `DocPage` model + admin UI (create/edit/publish/sort), published/draft visibility, and an `INTEGRATIONS` doc category.
- Docs browsing UX: `DocsShell`/`DocsBrowser` with category tabs, search, pagination, last-updated metadata, and a clear "Read" CTA on cards; markdown fallbacks remain for unpublished docs.
- Admin CMS tools: blog manager with Markdown editor/preview, post table, and helper copy; docs manager with category/status controls; refreshed partners/testimonials admin lists.
- Product/pricing system: product CRUD APIs (`/api/products` + catalog endpoints), pricing helpers for plans/add-ons, admin product manager, add-on selector, FAQ, donations tab, custom pricing CTA, and current-plan display.
- Markdown source docs added for hosting/users/main (API, custom domains, getting started, architecture, user guides) to back the new docs system.

- Redis caching infrastructure: new cache modules (`upload-cache`, `config-cache`, `session-cache`, `rate-limit`, `general-cache`) to offload transient data from Prisma/filesystem.
- Upload metadata caching: chunked upload metadata now stored in Redis (with filesystem fallback) for faster multi-instance coordination.
- Session and user lookup caching: Redis-backed caching for auth lookups with automatic invalidation on profile changes.
- Rate limiting: Redis-based sliding-window and fixed-window rate limiters applied to registration and contact endpoints.
- OCR safeguards: configurable `OCR_MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH` and `MAX_OCR_FILE_SIZE` environment variables to prevent memory exhaustion.
- Page metadata: added `buildPageMetadata` exports to auth pages (login, register, forgot, reset), changelogs, blog listing, and created wrapper layouts for client-only pages (verify-email, alpha-migration, setup); added `generateMetadata` to dynamic routes (`blog/[slug]`, `legal/[...slug]`) for proper SEO.

### Changed
- Server-side password verification when disabling 2FA: DELETE `/api/profile/2fa` now requires account password and verifies with `bcrypt.compare` before clearing 2FA.
- Client robustness fixes: include credentials on profile/2fa fetches, unwrap API response envelope (`payload.data ?? payload`), visible fetch errors and debug logs to surface failures.
- Navigation & UI tweaks: `BaseNav` avatar now links to `/dashboard/profile` to match `UserNav`, mobile sheet trigger/footers improved, and modal z-index/overflow fixes.
- Navigation dropdown chevrons now animate/rotate on desktop for both base and dashboard navs.
- Pricing page restructured into tabs (plans, add-ons, donations, FAQ) with billing toggle and expandable plan details.
- Documentation pages now resolve from the database first and fall back to markdown; category routing and slug inference updated for integrations.
- Updated knip configuration (incorrect entrypoints).
- Updated husky configs and lint-staged.
- Legal routing now uses only `/legal/[...slug]` backed by the database (markdown fallback removed; legacy individual legal routes deleted); legal content expanded across all policies (Terms, Privacy, Cookies, Security, AUP, Accessibility, SLA, Refund, GDPR, DMCA) and contact points standardized to email.
- Event worker defaults reduced: batch size lowered to 3–5 and concurrency to 1 to reduce DB/memory pressure.
- Event handler execution changed from parallel `Promise.all` to sequential processing to prevent spikes.
- `getScheduledEvents` now enforces a `take` limit (default 100) to prevent unbounded result sets.
- Config and setup status lookups now use Redis cache with short TTL and in-memory fallback.
- **UI overhaul**: site-wide glass-morphism styling applied across all dashboard pages, cards, panels, and components (`bg-white/10 dark:bg-black/10 backdrop-blur-xl border-white/20 dark:border-white/10`).
- Dashboard components restyled: `SharedFileCard`, `VerificationCodesPanel`, `DataExplorer`, `ProfileAppearance`, file grid cards, URLs page, Upload page, Domains page, and Paste pages all updated with consistent glass aesthetic.
- Changelog repo filter: replaced native `<select>` element with the site's `Select` component for visual consistency.
- Themed logo component (`Icons.logo`) verified as the standard across all pages and components; press pages intentionally use static images for media downloads.
- 2FA QR code rendering switched from server-side `qrcode` to client-side `QRCodeSVG` (`qrcode.react`) to eliminate `Buffer()` deprecation warning; QR container now has white background for theme compatibility with centered Emberly logo overlay.
- Domains page completely redesigned: stats cards showing total/verified/pending counts, Cloudflare recommendation banner (dismissible), collapsible domain rows with inline DNS configuration display, and improved empty states.

### Fixed
- Fixed broken JSX/parse error in `components/profile/security/profile-security.tsx` and restored a working client component.
- Fixed disable-modal not opening (modal nesting and button `type` issues resolved) and added a visible click debug counter during troubleshooting.
- Resolved "Loading QR…" / 2FA state mismatch by fetching secrets at the correct lifecycle point and adding an initial `Checking 2FA…` UI while profile loads.
- Exposed `updateProfile()` from profile hook to resolve `updateProfile is not a function` runtime error.
- Defensive guards and runtime checks added across profile/settings pages to prevent TypeErrors (e.g., safe access of `quotas`).
- Metadata robustness: Next metadata generation now validates inputs/base URLs, falls back to minimal metadata when data is missing/invalid, and avoids serialization crashes for embeds/OG cards.
- Video delivery: local storage provider routes video extensions (mp4/webm/mov/avi/mkv) through `/api/files` for range-friendly playback and honors host overrides for correct streaming URLs.
- Legal catch-all route now awaits `params` to avoid Next.js "params is a Promise" runtime errors.
- Fixed event worker memory leaks and "heap out of memory" crashes by limiting batch sizes, concurrency, and adding OCR queue/file-size caps.
- Fixed Prisma "Connection terminated unexpectedly" errors by reducing parallel DB load in event processing.
- Fixed paste form Language/Filename inputs not aligning properly by adding `items-end` grid alignment and explicit input heights.
- Fixed duplicate `border-white/10` class warning in `BlogToc.tsx`.
- Fixed Prisma client imports across 17 files to use the generated client path (`@/prisma/generated/prisma/client`) instead of `@prisma/client`, resolving Turbopack module resolution errors during build.
- Fixed TypeScript build errors: config path in verification-codes page, missing `id` prop on `GlassCard`, `billingPeriod` type annotation in pricing helpers, extra argument in admin email logs API, invalid `_sum2` in analytics summary, Map type and property names in top-users analytics, logger fallbacks and payload type annotations in domain routes.


## [1.0.0-alpha.6] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- Snowfall site-wide visual: falling snow canvas that activates when a Christmas/Holly theme is in use (client canvas component + theme-aware detection).
- Per-user appearance settings: theme presets, hue overrides, live preview on the client, and persistence to the user's profile (`theme` stored on `User`).
- New server APIs and components:
  - Profile 2FA endpoints (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/profile/2fa`) to generate TOTP secrets and QR codes, verify tokens, enable and disable 2FA (server-side QR generation via `qrcode` + `otplib`).
  - Partners and Testimonials server APIs and admin UIs (partners CRUD, testimonial submission/management), plus homepage partners carousel wired to server data.
  - Profile Data Explorer: server `GET /api/profile` and a client JSON viewer for exporting/inspecting account data.
- UI components and client flows added: `ProfileAppearance` (appearance tab), `ThemeInitializer` client script, `Snowfall` component, 2FA UI scaffolding in profile security (temporarily blurred as "Coming soon").
- Prisma schema changes & migrations for new data models and fields: `Partner`, `Testimonial`, `twoFactorEnabled`, `twoFactorSecret`, and related migration files applied locally during development.
- Package additions for server-side 2FA/QRCodes: `otplib` and `qrcode`.

### Changed
- Theme propagation and client hydration: `data-theme` is now set on the `<html>` element and a small client initializer ensures the system/site theme is applied before React hydration so client-only features (Snowfall, previews) reliably reflect system-level site appearance.
- `hooks/use-profile.ts` now exposes `updateProfile()` and the profile API `PUT /api/profile` accepts `theme` and persists appearance changes.
- Navigation and header updates:
  - `BaseNav` aligned with `UserNav`: desktop avatar links directly to `/dashboard/profile`.
  - Mobile sheet trigger moved to the right and renders the signed-in user's avatar (falls back to menu icon when not signed in).
  - Mobile sections are toggleable and only the `base` section is open by default.
  - Mobile sheet now closes automatically on footer actions (Sign In/Register/Profile/Dashboard/Sign Out).
- Tabs, list UIs and dropdowns improved for better small-screen overflow and keyboard/outside-click behaviours (Radix primitives adopted for consistent focus management).
- Changelogs, partners, testimonials and ST5 pages refactored to use shared layout primitives (`PageShell`, `DashboardWrapper`) and improved responsive layouts.

### Fixed
- Defensive checks and runtime guards added to Settings, profile and other pages to prevent TypeErrors (e.g. attempting to access `quotas` on undefined objects).
- Admin role checks updated to treat `SUPERADMIN` equivalently to `ADMIN` where appropriate (settings/posts/admin routes and UIs).
- Resolved `updateProfile is not a function` by returning `updateProfile` from the profile hook the client uses.
- Snowfall visibility issues resolved by ensuring server-configured/system-level themes set `data-theme` on the document root and by improving Snowfall to observe both `data-theme` and document `className`.
- Prisma schema changes for 2FA and other models were added and migrations applied during development (see migrations folder).
- Misc layout and accessibility bug fixes across navs, modals, and small-screen components (modal scrolling, focus traps, dropdown outside-click behaviour, mobile overflow fixes).


## [1.0.0-alpha.5] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- Persisted partners to the database with a new `Partner` Prisma model and migration.
- Admin partner management UI (`/dashboard/partners`) with create/edit/delete and an empty-state.
- Server API routes for partners (`/api/partners` and `/api/partners/[id]`) supporting public GET and admin-protected create/update/delete.
- Homepage partners carousel wired to server data so partners can be surfaced dynamically.
 - New `Testimonial` Prisma model, migrations, and server APIs for public and admin operations (`/api/testimonials`).
 - Profile testimonial UI allowing users to submit, edit, archive, or delete a single testimonial from their profile.
 - Admin testimonial management in the dashboard with approve/hide/archive controls.
 - Public testimonial listing component with avatar support (image or initials fallback) and star-rating display.
 - Profile Data Explorer: added server GET for `/api/profile` and a client JSON viewer for exporting/inspecting account data.

### Changed
- Home page now fetches active partners server-side and conditionally renders the partners carousel.
- `components/partners/partners-carousel.tsx` refactored to accept server-driven `partners` props and fixed a JSX parsing bug.
- Navigation: added `Partners` admin link to both base and dashboard navigation.
- Error and Not Found pages standardized to use the site's fixed header (`BaseNav` / `DashboardNav` + `UserNav`), `DynamicBackground`, and a centered card layout for visual consistency.
- Dialog primitive and modals updated to cap height and enable internal scrolling for better mobile behavior; applied to edit/view user modals.
 - Standardized layout and theme across the site so pages use a consistent `PageShell` / `DashboardWrapper` composition with `BaseNav`, `DashboardNav`, `DynamicBackground`, and shared spacing/typography tokens.
 - Testimonial APIs updated to support `?mine=true` for fetching the current user's testimonial and admin `?all=true` for full lists.
 - Profile submit flow now enforces one testimonial per user (client shows Edit when a testimonial exists); POST creates only when no existing testimonial is present.
 - `components/testimonials` presentation refactored to use `Avatar` with initials fallback and a responsive card/grid layout.

### Fixed
- Guarded and unwrapped API responses in the dashboard partners list so `partners` is always an array (resolved `partners.map is not a function`).
- Fixed modal overflow on small screens so modals are scrollable and close controls remain accessible.
- Repaired a syntax/parse error in the partners carousel implementation.
- Various small layout and runtime fixes related to the partners integration and admin tooling.
 - Fixed client-side handling of API envelopes so `data === null` is not treated as an existing testimonial.
 - Added safe date parsing for testimonial `createdAt` to prevent display of `Invalid Date`.
 - Render testimonial ratings as star icons and added responsive button layout for mobile-friendly actions (submit/edit/delete/archive).
 - Resolved several runtime/hydration issues found while wiring testimonials and profile APIs (including Radix focus-group SSR fix and missing icon imports).


## [1.0.0-alpha.4] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- Public access for the pricing page via updated middleware constants.
- Navigation menus and dropdowns for both the main website and dashboard.
- Expanded analytics tracking for user actions and page visits.
- New analytics endpoints and improved dashboard analytics display.
 - `PageShell` applied across public pages (blog, docs, legal) for consistent header and content layout.
 - Table-style listing components used for blog, docs, and legal hub indexes for tighter, more readable lists.
 - New legal pages: Refund Policy and Service Level Agreement (SLA) with detailed policy text.
 - `DashboardWrapper` now supports a `nav` prop to choose between base and dashboard navigation contexts.

 - Analytics server routes: `overview`, `storage`, `top-items`, `top-users`, and `metrics/activity` providing timeseries, top-10 lists, and storage summaries.
 - Top users scoring & privacy model: primary + composite scoring (downloads + clicks, avg-per-file) and privacy-aware responses (anonymized distribution for non-admins, full list for admins).
 - Changelogs feature: server route `/api/changelogs` (GitHub releases fetch), `components/changelogs/ChangelogList.tsx`, and `/changelogs` page to list organizational releases (uses `react-markdown` for release bodies).
 - Recharts added for dashboard charts and visualizations.
 - Client UI components: `PageShell`, `DocsCard` (table-style), changelogs list with expandable rows and search, and analytics overview components.

### Changed
- Blog management layout now restricts post creation/management to admin users only.
- Refined analytics event structure and improved data consistency.
- Updated navigation logic for better user experience.
 - Main and dashboard navigation dropdowns converted to managed `DropdownMenu` primitives (replacing CSS hover groups) for reliable outside-click closing and keyboard interaction.
 - Public layout now uses a `ConditionalBaseNav` so the base navigation is only shown where appropriate; `DashboardWrapper` renders the dashboard header only when required.
 - Blog and docs index views refactored from card grids into the shared `Table` UI component.
 - Legal subpages refactored to use `PageShell` with compact left navigation and prose-based content; legal hub uses table rows and includes Refund and SLA links.

 - Docs layout: left TOC converted to a compact card for desktop and the mobile TOC toggle simplified to a small disclosure. `DocsToc` updated to hide on large screens in favor of the left card nav.
 - `PageShell` updated to integrate with `DashboardWrapper` so public pages show the same dynamic background and header as dashboard pages.
 - Changelogs page: moved to `DashboardWrapper`-backed layout for consistent background, and `ChangelogList` styling refactored to a compact table with expanders.
 - Added `react-markdown` and adjusted `package.json` to include the dependency (client-side markdown rendering in changelogs).

 - Navigation UX: `BaseNav` is now a fixed header so it scrolls consistently with the page; `ConditionalBaseNav` renders a spacer to prevent content overlap with the fixed header.
 - `DashboardNav` mobile sheet now includes a profile / auth footer area (sign in / register / profile / sign out) so account actions remain accessible on small screens.
 - Improved responsive nav behavior to prevent link overflow on smaller screens and to centralize nav rendering responsibilities.

### Fixed
- Navigation menu dropdowns.
- Various navigation and menu-related bugs.
- Fixed broken analytics event reporting and dashboard stats.
- Addressed issues with analytics data aggregation and display.
- Minor UI/UX bugs across dashboard and public pages.
 - Resolved duplicate/overlapping navigation rendering on public pages by centralizing base nav rendering and gating the dashboard header.
 - Desktop dropdowns now reliably auto-close on outside click and behave consistently across pages.
 - Fixed several small layout regressions introduced during nav and hero refactors.

  - Fixed base navigation overlap by making the base header fixed and adding a spacer via `ConditionalBaseNav`.
  - Added mobile sheet footer to `DashboardNav` to surface auth/profile actions and prevent layout overflow.
  - Resolved additional responsive overflow issues for dashboard nav links on narrow viewports.

 - Fixed duplicate variable declarations and hook-order issues introduced during iterative changes (`TopUsers.tsx`, `top-users` route, and `ChangelogList.tsx`).
 - Corrected top-users scoring inconsistency by introducing `compositeScore` weighting to account for `filesCount` so users with many files do not score lower unfairly.
 - Fixed a Hook ordering bug in `ChangelogList.tsx` so expand state is declared before early returns.
 - Various build fixes and runtime stability improvements encountered while wiring the new pages and APIs.
